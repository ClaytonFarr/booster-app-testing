# Booster Testing

- [x] note expected fake app behavior
- [x] test fake app is working as intended
- [x] get 1st integration test in working state
- [x] clean up organization of helper functions
- [x] re-review references for additional techniques/ideas
- [x] check if any parts of test helpers are no longer needed
- [x] make test work in AWS deployed environment
- [x] check if test updates can fire vitest HMR

- [ ] note expectations for each element / integration
- [ ] create test example for each type of integration
- [ ] attempt to abstract test patterns into reusable functions

- [ ] create 2nd integration test
- [ ] sort out how to make these tests show up in coverage report

- leaning on Booster framework tests for core functionality coverage (e.g. commands processing successfully, events reducing into entities, entities projecting into read models, etc.)

# Test Patterns

**A Command**

- âœ… should accept specific parameters(s)
- âœ… should fail when required parameters are missing
- âœ… should succeed if submitting only required parameter(s)
- âœ… should fail if parameters values are empty ('')
- âœ… should fail if parameters are invalid type
- âœ… should register specific event(s)
- âœ… should perform certain work
- ðŸš§ should fail if request not authorized

**A Scheduled Command**

- xxx

**An Event Handler**

- xxx

**An Event**

- should update specific entity(ies)

**An Entity**

- may update specific read model(s)

**A Read Model**

- should project specific entity data

## Testing Notes

- when testing live
  - run `npm run test:live`
    - will deploy test stack to AWS
  - if make changes to code
    - in new terminal run `boost deploy -e test`
    - in original terminal (where tests running), press `a` to re-run tests
  - when cancel process in original terminal, should nuke deployed test stack

## Testing Automation Notes

@syntax is optional for test automation.

**Command: Event keys**

- must be first arguments in event constructor
- must be in this order:
  - @requiredInput: input variables required to trigger event
  - @aReducingEntity: an entity that will be updated by event (required to lookup event in datastore)

**Command: Work keys (@work00)**

- can be any where in document
- can include any unique (within document) two-digit key
- require:
  - @work00: brief description of work to be done
  - @work00-inputs: input name and value (e.g. { name: 'fruit', value: 'apple' })
    - currently presumes work can be triggered by single input parameter
  - @work01-entity: an entity that will be updated by event (required to lookup event in datastore)
  - @work01-result: value to test if work was done
    - can be `true` or `false` if want to test yes/no of work done
    - can be a string to test work result value
      - currently presumes result value exists on field with same name as @work00-inputs `name`
